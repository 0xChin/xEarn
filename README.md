# xEarn
Implementation of a cross-chain yield aggregator using [Connext Network](https://www.connext.network/). Motivated by UX issues in the ecosystem: "decentralized application users should not need to consciously think about what chain they are on, or how to move between chains"[‚ÇÅ](https://docs.connext.network/concepts/what-is-connext#why-do-we-need-xapps) and a personal interest in blockchains interoperability <3

Project made for [ETHGlobal "Scaling Ethereum" hackathon](https://ethglobal.com/events/scaling2023)
